- 👋 Hi, I’m Koushik Das aka @mr-oogway
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep Learning (learning and testing different architectures) and MLOps, specially the maths behind.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying research papers and trying to implement the ideas.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on Kaggle Competitions and real-world projects.
